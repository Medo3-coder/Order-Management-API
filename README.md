## Overview
This is a simple Order Management API built using Laravel 10. It manages `Customer` and `Order` data with CRUD operations and basic analytics. The API was developed as part of a candidate task, leveraging AI tools for efficiency.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **PHP** (>= 8.1)
- **Composer** (https://getcomposer.org/)
- **Node.js** and **NPM** (optional, for frontend if added later)
- A database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL)
- **Postman** or similar API testing tool (optional)

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - If using GitHub, clone the repo:
     ```bash
     git clone <your-repo-url>
     cd order-management-api
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Run the following command to install Laravel dependencies:
     ```bash
     composer install
     ```

3. **Configure the Environment**
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Update the `.env` file with your database settings. For simplicity, use SQLite:
     ```
     DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
     DB_DATABASE=/absolute/path/to/database/database.sqlite
     ```
   - Generate an application key:
     ```bash
     php artisan key:generate
     ```

4. **Run Migrations**
   - Apply the database migrations to create the `customers` and `orders` tables:
     ```bash
     php artisan migrate
     ```

## Running the Project
1. **Start the Laravel Server**
   - Run the built-in PHP server:
     ```bash
     php artisan serve
     ```
   - The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

2. **Access the API**
   - Use a tool like Postman or cURL to interact with the endpoints (see [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints)).

## API Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints under the `/api` prefix:

- **POST /orders**
  - Create a new order.
  - Request Body:
    ```json
    {
        "customer_id": 1,
        "product_name": "Laptop",
        "quantity": 2,
        "price": 1500.50
    }
    ```
  - Response: 201 Created with order details.

- **GET /orders**
  - List all orders (optional filter by `status`).
  - Query Parameter: `?status=pending` or `?status=shipped`
  - Response: 200 OK with a list of orders.

- **PUT /orders/{id}**
  - Update the status of an order.
  - Request Body:
    ```json
    {
        "status": "shipped"
    }
    ```
  - Response: 200 OK with updated order.

- **GET /orders/stats**
  - Get total revenue and order count per status.
  - Response: 200 OK with stats:
    ```json
    {
        "total_revenue": 2800.48,
        "orders_per_status": {
            "pending": 2,
            "shipped": 1
        }
    }
    ```

## Seeding the Database
To populate the database with sample data:
1. Run the seeders:
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```
2. This will create two customers and three orders based on the `CustomerSeeder` and `OrderSeeder`.

## Testing the API
- **Manual Testing:**
  - Use Postman or cURL to test each endpoint (see [Using Postman](#using-postman)).
- **Automated Testing (Optional):**
  - Run Laravel’s built-in tests if implemented:
    ```bash
    php artisan test
    ```

## Using Postman
Here’s how to test the `GET /orders/stats` endpoint in Postman:
1. Open Postman and select `GET`.
2. Enter the URL: `http://localhost:8000/api/orders/stats`.
3. Click **Send**.
4. Verify the response matches the expected stats based on seeded data (e.g., total revenue of 2800.48).

Save the request as “Get Order Stats” for reuse.

## Project Structure
- `app/Models/`
  - `Customer.php`: Defines the Customer model.
  - `Order.php`: Defines the Order model with a relationship to Customer.
- `app/Http/Controllers/`
  - `OrderController.php`: Handles API logic.
- `app/Http/Requests/`
  - Form Requests for validation (e.g., `StoreOrderRequest.php`).
- `database/migrations/`
  - Migration files for `customers` and `orders` tables.
- `database/seeders/`
  - `CustomerSeeder.php` and `OrderSeeder.php` for sample data.
- `routes/api.php`
  - Defines the API routes.

## Bonus Features
- **Filtering:** Add `?status=pending` to the `GET /orders` endpoint to filter orders by status.
- **Scaling Considerations:** Could use Laravel queues for order processing and Redis caching for the `stats` endpoint.

## Improvements and Future Work
- Add authentication (e.g., Laravel Sanctum) to secure endpoints.
- Implement more robust validation (e.g., unique product names per customer).
- Write automated tests using Laravel’s testing framework.
- Add error handling for edge cases (e.g., invalid `customer_id`).
